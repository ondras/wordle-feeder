# wordle-feeder

This simple puppeteer script makes two opposing Wordle implementations play against each other. In particular:

  1. it takes input attempts from [Adverwordle](https://adverswordle.doteye.online/) and
  2. feeds them to the regular [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
  
If everything goes right, both games are won (guessed) at the same time.
